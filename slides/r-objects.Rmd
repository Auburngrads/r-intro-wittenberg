# OVERVIEW

## In this presentation...

- Describe the types of elements used to create R objects

- Define and create the primary classes of R objects

    + Vectors

    + Matrices

    + Data frames

    + Lists

    + Functions

- Introduce more complex objects

# R OBJECTS: Elements

## In R Elements Have an Atomic Structure

- Elements aren't really objects in R, but are single-valued vectors

- However, the term 'element' is helpful to distinguish between types of objects in a vector 

- Elements Have One of Six Atomic modes

- Function calls on objects containing elements with different atomic modes coerces the "higher" mode element to that of the "lowest" mode element

<center>**raw** $\rightarrow$ **logical** $\rightarrow$ **integer** $\rightarrow$ **numeric** $\rightarrow$ **complex** $\rightarrow$ **character**</center>

<br>

```{r} 
2 < "george"
```

```{r} 
2 > "george"
```

```{r} 
-2 < "-3"
```

```{r} 
-2 < FALSE
```

## Coercing Elements to Other Atomic Modes

- In many cases you can coerce elements and objects to higher atomic modes

```{r} 
as.complex(-2)
```

```{r} 
as.character(-2)
```

```{r} 
as.logical(-2) ### Only 0 returns as FALSE
```

## Logical operators applied to numeric elements

```{r} 
2 == 3
```

```{r} 
2 > 3
```

```{r} 
2 <= 3
```

```{r} 
2 < 3 | 2 > 3  ### Is EITHER 2<3 OR 2>3 true?
```

```{r} 
2 < 3 & 2 > 3  ### Are BOTH 2<3 AND 2>3 true?
```

## Mathematical Functions on Numeric Elements

```{r}
sqrt(4)
```  

```{r}
exp(1)
```  

```{r}
log(1)
``` 

```{r}
log10(1)
``` 

```{r}
ceiling(pi)
``` 

```{r}
floor(pi)
``` 

```{r}
factorial(5)
``` 

```{r}
choose(4,2)
``` 

# R Objects: Vectors

## Vectors are the Base Data Structure in R

- Scalars are interpreted as a vectors containing a single element  

- Vectors can be created using one of four functions

    + `a:b` creates a vector of integer-differenced values $\in [a,b]$

    + `c( )` concatenates various elements or vectors together

    + `rep( )` repeats elements or patterns of elements

    + `seq(m,n,o)` generates a number sequence between $m$ and $n$ in $o$ increments

- "Binding" elements of different modes into a vector will coerce all of the elements into the lowest atomic mode

- <focus>Functions can be applied to entire vectors - without loops</focus>

## The Concatenate Function - c( )

- `c( )` Coerces elements with various atomic modes into a vector object

- Each element in the vector will have same atomic mode - whichever mode is lowest among the elements being concatenated

```{r} 
A <- c(1,2,3,4,5) ; A
```

```{r} 
B <- c(6,7,8,9,10) ; B
```

```{r} 
C <- c(A,B,"George") ; C  ### Coerces the numbers in A & B to characters 
```

## The Repeat Function - rep( )

- Vector formed by repeating an element or pattern of elements 

```{r} 
D <- rep(1,10); D
```

```{r} 
E <- rep(c(1,2,3,4),5); E
```

```{r} 
G <- rep(c(1,2,3,4), each=5); G
```

## The Sequence Function - seq( )

- Vector formed by sequencing elements, in a specified interval or to a specified length

```{r} 
H <- seq(1,10) ; H
```

```{r} 
I <- seq(4,20,by=4) ; I
```

```{r} 
J <- seq(1,2, by=.1) ; J
```

```{r} 
K <- seq(10,2, by=-0.5) ; K
```

```{r} 
L <- seq(10,2, length=7) ; L
```

## Vector Structure

- Let's look at the structure of the vector `J` defined previously

- To do this we can use the structure function `str( )`

- <focus>Remember, str( ) is every R users best friend</focus>

```{r}
str(J)
```

- `num` - shows that this is a numeric vector

- `[1:11]` - shows that `J` has 1 dimension with values in positions 1-11

- As will be shown when discussing matrices, the dimensions of an $11 \times 11$ matrix are expressed as `[1:11, 1:11]` 

## Logical Functions on Vectors

- Is <u>either</u> $(\overline{A}<\overline{B})$ <u>or</u> $(\overline{A}>\overline{B})$ true? 

```{r} 
A < B | A > B
```

```{r} 
A < B || A > B
```

- Are <u>both</u> $(\overline{A}<\overline{B})$ <u>and</u> $(\overline{A}>\overline{B})$ true?

```{r} 
A < B & A > B
```

```{r} 
A < B && A > B
```

## Mathematical Functions on Vectors

```{r} 
A + B
```

```{r} 
A * B ## Scalar multiplication
```

```{r} 
A%*%B ##  Matrix multiplication
```

```{r}
round(sqrt(A),digits = 3)
```  

```{r}
round(exp(A),digits = 2)
```  

```{r}
round(log(A),digits = 3)
``` 

```{r}
round(log10(A),digits=3)
``` 

```{r}
sum(A)
``` 

```{r}
cumsum(A)
``` 

```{r}
prod(B)
``` 

```{r}
cumprod(B)
``` 

```{r}
t(A) ### Returns the transpose of A
```

```{r}
t(t(A))
```

```{r}
abs(-B/2)
```

```{r}
table(c(A,B/2)) ### displays how many times each unique value is observed 
```

## Accessing And Assigning Vector Elements Using Brackets

```{r}
A ### Recall the value of the vector A defined earlier
```

```{r}
A[3] ## Returns the 3rd element of A
```

```{r}
A[1] <- 0.1 ; A ## Assigns the 1st element of A as 0.1
```

```{r}
A[-1] <- 4 ; A ## Assigns all but the 1st element of A as 4 
```

```{r}
A < 0.5
```

```{r}
A[4] == 2
```

# R OBJECTS: Matrices

## Matricies combine Atomic Vectors in a 2-dimensional Framework

- In R, matrices are created using one of three methods

    + 1) Define the dimensions of a matrix and add elements later

    + 2) Adding elements interactively with `edit( )`

    + 3) Merge or bind vectors together (must be of equal length) 

- Matrices are atomic, i.e. every element has the same atomic mode 

- Creating matrices from elements or vectors with different atomic modes will coerce every element to the lowest mode 

## Building Matrices 1 - Specifying Individual Elements

- The `matrix( )` function is used to create a matrix object with the following arguments

    + `data` - Values to include in the matrix

    + `ncol` - Number of columns

    + `nrow` - Number of rows

    + `byrow` - Fill the matrix rows or by columns?

    + `dimnames` - Names applied to row and column headers 

```{r}
mat <- matrix(data = 1:9, 
              ncol = 3, 
              nrow = 3, 
              byrow = TRUE, 
              dimnames = list(c('A','B','C'),
                              c('D','E','F'))) 
mat
```

## Building matrices 2 - interactively with `edit( )`

- This interactive 'GUI' method can be very fast, but requires user input

- Start by creating a $1 \times 1$ numeric matrix - the value you use doesn't matter

```{r}
mat2 <- matrix(1)
```

- Then, use `edit()` to bring up a spreadsheet-style editor window

- Make whatever changes you like to the matrix, then hit <orange>file $\rightarrow$ close</orange>

- Note <focus>You must re-define the matrix object or your changes will not be saved</focus>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mat2 <- edit(mat2)
```

## Building Matrices by Merging Vectors

- Vectors <focus>of the same length</focus> can be merged to build matrices

- Note the use of `c( )` to ensure that `vec1, vec2, vec3, vec4` are all part of the argument `data`, and not considered as four separate arguments

```{r}
vec1 <-  1:4
vec2 <-  5:8
vec3 <-  9:12
vec4 <- 13:16
vec.mat <- matrix(data = c(vec1, vec2, vec3, vec4), 
                  ncol = 4) 
vec.mat
```

- Matrices can also be built with `rbind` & `cbind` to merge vectors as rows or columns

- Note that and `cbind` will coerce every element to the same atomic mode

```{r}
rbind(vec1, vec2, vec3, vec4)
```

```{r}
cbind(vec1, vec2, vec3, vec4)
```

## Numerical operations on matricies

- Matrix operations that are often of interest include

    + Returning the diagonal elements of a matrix
    
    + Computing the determinant of a matrix

    + Finding the inverse of a matrix

    + Finding the transpose of a matrix

    + Computing the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

- To demonstrate matrix operations, let's first create a $5 \times 5$ matrix of random integers in $[1,50]$

```{r}
mat1 <- matrix(sample(1:50,size = 25), 
               nrow = 5, 
               byrow = T) 
mat1
```

```{r}
diag(mat1)  ### Diagonal elements `mat1`
```

```{r}
det(mat1)   ### Determinant of `mat1`
```

```{r}
solve(mat1) ### Returns the inverse `mat1` if it exists
```

```{r}
t(mat1) ### Returns the tranpose of `mat1`
```

```{r}
eigen(mat1) ### Returns the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of `mat1`
```

## Accessing & Assigning matrix components

- Matrix elements can be accessed by specifying their `[row,column]` values

- Matrix elements can also be accessed by specifying a single `[element.index]`  

- Matrix rows/columns can be accessed by specifying `[row,]` or `[,column]`

```{r}
mat1[4,3]
```

```{r}
mat1[5,5]
```

```{r}
mat1[7]
```

```{r}
mat1[24]
```
 
```{r}
mat1[1,] ### Returns the first row of mat1
```

```{r}
mat1[,3] ### Returns the third column of mat1
```

# R OBJECTS: Arrays

## Arrays are element Repositories With More than Two Dimensions

- The syntax for function calls on arrays are similar to what was described for vectors and matrices

- Arrays are atomic

# R OBJECTS: Data Frames

## Data Frames Are The Most Common Data Structure In R

- Data frames are NOT atomic - but are comprised of atomic column vectors

- Data frames are like atricies - but each column can have a different atomic mode

## Creating data frames

- Data frames are primarily created by using the function `data.frame()` 

    + NEVER use `rbind` or `cbind` to create a data.frame

    + Recall `rbind` & `cbind` coerces every element in every vector to the lowest atomic mode

```{r}
age<-c(23, 35, 19)              ### Numeric vector
sex<-c("Male", "Female", "Yes") ### Character vector
job<-c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)       ### Logical vector
data.frame(age,sex,job, row.names = c("Jim", "Joe", "Ray"))
```

- Data frames can also be created by loading local or online files

    + `read.table` loads tab-delimited data from .txt files (NotePad)

    + `read.csv` creates a data.frame from .csv files (installs w/ base R)

    + `read_excel` creates a data.frame from .xls and .xlsx files (requires the readxl package)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read.csv("http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.csv", header = T)
```

## Accessing data frames components

R installs with several data sets, such as `mtcars`

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

```{r}
class(mtcars)
```

### Working With Data Frames


```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

The `$` operator is used to call data frame columns as `mtcars$cyl` 

# R OBJECTS: Lists

## Lists Are The Most General & Powerful Object Type in R

- Think of lists as a suitcase - they can be used to store everything

    + Vectors

    + Matrices

    + Data Frames

    + Functions

    + Even other lists

Example: Function outputs You write script that inputs the `cars` data set & creates several outputs

- The data set itself (a data.frame or matrix)

- Some summary statistics of the data set `summary(cars)`

- The maximum value of the log-likelihood function $\left(\mathcal{L}\right)$ a $1\times 1$ vector
 
You can assign each of these objects to a list  

## Atomic Vectors & Lists

- Concatenating numeric, logical and character elements results in an atomic-character vector

    + The vector is <u>**atomic**</u> because every element has the same atomic mode

    + Recall that `c( )` coerces every element to the lowest atomic mode that will ensure homogeneity across the entire vector

```{r}
V <- c(3,TRUE,"george") ; V
```

- Lists preserve the atomic mode of each object stored in the list

- And because lists can hold entire objects, the structure of each object stored in the list is preserved

```{r}
list1 <- list(3,TRUE,"george") ; list1
```

```{r}
list2 <- list(head(mtcars),"george", A) ; list2 
```

```{r}
str(list2)
```

### Accessing & Assigning List Components

Objects assigned to a list may be accessed by using double brackets `[[ ]]`

```{r}
 list1[[1]]
```

## Accessing & Assigning Components Of Objects Inside A List

- Components of objects stored in a list may also be accessed by 

    + 1) Using double brackets `[[ ]]` to call the vector, matrix, list, or data frame inside the list 

    + 2) Either `[ ]`, `[[ ]]`, or `$` to call the desired component of the object inside the list 

```{r}
 list2[[3]][1]
```

```{r}
 list2[[1]]$mpg
```

# R OBJECTS: Functions

## One Object to Rule Them All

- Functions convert input objects into either output objects or plots

    + Functions can take any object as an argument, even other functions 

    + Functions operate on distinct classes of objects (or functions)

    + Functions can return objects of the same class as the input objects or create a completely new class of object

## Parts of an R Function

- Functions are comprised of <red>four</red> basic parts 

    + The function <u>__symbol__</u> used to call the function

    + The <u>__formal argument(s)__</u>

    + The <u>__informal argument(s)__</u>

    + The function <u>__body__</u> defining the operations to be performed

## Creating and examining a function

- The code below creates an example function called `foo( )`, where...

    + `foo` $\hspace{10pt}$ - is the function <u>__symbol__</u> used to call the function

    + `x` $\hspace{18pt}$ - is a <u>__formal argument__</u>

    + `a,b` $\hspace{10pt}$ - are <u>__informal arguments__</u>

    + `a*x+b` $\hspace{1pt}$ - is the function <u>__body__</u> defining the operations to be performed

```{r}
foo <- function(x) { ### Values inside ( ) are interpreted as function arguments
  
  a <- 1 ; 
  b <- 2      ### Values separated by ";" are interpreted as separate lines 
  c <- a*x+b
  
  return(c)
}                  ### Values inside { } are interpreted as the function body
```

- The function `foo` is evaluated by specifying a value for the formal argument

    + In general, formal arguments can be numeric, character, or even other functions

    + For the function `foo`, the formal argument `x` must be either a vector or a matrix
    
    + Values are not specified for the informal arguments `a` and `b` since they we defined in the body of the function

```{r}
foo(2)
```

## Lexical Scoping Rules

- A problem arises, however, if I want to return the value of either `a` or `b` - an error is produced

    + This error results from the 'lexical scoping rules' on which R was built

    + Lexical scoping defines 'where' each object is defined and how we can interact with it 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
b  ### Error: object "b" not found
```

- When the function `foo( )` was created, three things happened

    + A new environment was created
    
    + The <u>__body__</u> of the function `foo( )` was assigned to this new environment
    
    + The <u>__symbol__</u> `foo` was assigned to the parent environment of this new environment

- The lexical scoping rules define how R searches for a requested value

    + First, R searches the current environment for the requested value

    + If the value is not found in the current environment, R then searches the parent environment to the current environment

    + If necessary, R continues to search sucessive parent environments until the Global Environment is reached

    + If the value isn't found in the Global Environment, R moves to the parent of the Global Environment - the Empty Environment
    
    + Upon reaching the Empty Environment, R stops searching and returns an error that the value cannot be found

- Thus, is the case of the function `foo( )`, `a` and `b` could not be found because...

    + They are local variables, assigned in the body of `foo`

    + Our request to find `a` and `b` was made in the parent environment to the body of `foo( )`, where only the symbol `foo` is available 

### Lexical Scoping Example

## Let's demonstrate where `foo` lives

- First, let's determine what is the current environment

- <focus>Note that this entire presentation has it's own environment</focus>

```{r}
environment( )
```

- Now, let's see in which environment the <u>__symbol__</u> `foo` is defined

- This should be the same environment as that's listed above

- BTW, if you refresh this presentation, this environment will be different

```{r}
environment(foo)
```

- The body of the function is defined in its own environment that is a child to the environment listed above

- This can be seen by examining the structure of `foo( )`

```{r}
str(foo) 
```

## What about when you're not in a presentation

- When R/RStudio is opened the current environment will be the Global environment

- Each new function created will have its own enclosing environment - only the function symbol can be accessed from the Global environment 

## Are there ways to make `a` and `b` available in the current environment?

- Yes, there are at least three ways to do this

    + 1) Define the `a` and `b` outside of the body of `foo( )`

    + Use `Return( )` to ensure `foo( )` returns `a` and `b` every time it is run

    + Use the deep-assignment operator `<<-`

- Each of these methods are shown below

```{r}
a <- 1 ; b <- 2 # Moving the informal arguments outside the function
foo <- function(x) { 
        a*x+b
}
foo(2) ; a ; b
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
foo <- function(x) { 
    a <- 1 ; b <- 2
    c <- a*x+b
    return(list(a,b,c))
}
foo(2)
```

```{r}
foo2<-function(x) { 
    a <<- 1 ; b <<- 2
    c <- a*x+b
}
foo(2) ; a ; b
```

### R Environments

R arrives at the same result regardless of where `a` and `b` are defined

This is due to search procedure defined by the lexical scoping rules

1) R first searches the function's enclosing environment for `a` and `b`
2) If not found in the enclosing environment, R searches the parent environment
3) This continues until R finds `a` and `b` or the search reaches the empty environment

The empty environment is the parent to the global environment

### `Return( )` Allows Multiple Function Outputs



### Use `<<-` to Assign in Parent Environment


The deep-assignment operator allows an inheritance to the parent environment


Use carefully, `<<-` can change base R values, giving unexpected side effects 

### Lexical Scoping Rules Example - 2

## Look at the code chunk below 

- What value do you think will be returned for `bar(2)`?

- Don't scroll down until you've decided on an answer

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
a<-1
b<-2

foo<-function(x) {
    a*x+b
}

bar<-function(x){
  a<-2
  b<-1
  foo(x)
}

bar(2)
```

## What value did you choose?

- The correct answer is 5

- Rationale

    + `foo` cannot access the values of `a` and `b` defined within `bar`  

    + The only values R can find for `a` and `b` are those defined in the global environment

    + The `a` and `b` values defined in `bar` are threfore ignored

```{r}
bar(2)
```
